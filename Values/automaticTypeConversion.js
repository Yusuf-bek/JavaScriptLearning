console.log(8 * null)
// → 0
console.log("5" - 1)
// → 4
console.log("5" + 1)
// → 51
console.log("five" * 2)
// → NaN
console.log(false == 0)
// → true

// when operator applied in wrong way 
// Javascript automatically converts to other type

console.log('3' - 2)
console.log("3.3" + 5)

// this might lead to major complexity or problem
// but anyways who cares. This is JavaScript and there are plenty of jobs 
// works that i can do with it. So nothing is perfect

console.log("i might find" - 3)
console.log("nine" * 2)


// but i really liked this one

console.log(false == 0)
console.log(true == 1)

// first time i have seen it in python
// which languages converts 0 to false and 1 to true when it is needed
