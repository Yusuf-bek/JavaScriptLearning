console.log(8 * null)
// → 0
console.log("5" - 1)
// → 4
console.log("5" + 1)
// → 51
console.log("five" * 2)
// → NaN
console.log(false == 0)

// when operator applied in wrong way 
// Javascript automatically converts to other type

console.log('3' - 2)
console.log("3.3" + 5)

// this might lead to major complexity or problem
// but anyways who cares. This is JavaScript and there are plenty of jobs 
// works that i can do with it. So nothing is perfect

console.log("i might find" - 3)
console.log("nine" * 2)


// but i really liked this one

console.log(false == 0)
console.log(true == 1)

// first time i have seen it in python
// which languages converts 0 to false and 1 to true when it is needed


console.log('is undefined equal to null: ', undefined == null)
// => true

// some conclusions 
// null is a value, any variable could be null 

console.log("is null equal to null: ", null == null)
// => true
console.log("is undefined equal to undefined: ", undefined == undefined)
// => true

// difference between null and undefined is 
// undefined is nothing with identity of nothing
// the null could be string, integer or anything with no value 
// 
// just basically saying null and undefined has basically same genes
//
// null = nothing with identity
// undefined = nothing with no identity

// nothing = nothing
